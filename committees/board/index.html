            The chapter's board is responsible for coordinating the chapter's committees, and for the strategic and longer term goals of the chapter.
            <br/>
            The operational work of the chapter is managed by the different committees and trustees, although the board shall support them in their work should they need it.
            <br/>
            The primary tasks of the board are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>To take care of the chapters ongoing operational matters.</li>
            <li>To administer budgeted means.</li>
            <li>To coordinate the activities of the committees.</li>
            <li>To summon and arrange the chapter meeting.</li>
            <li>To work out and propose an operational plan and budget for the coming year to be approved by the chapter meeting.</li>
            <li>To work strategically towards a vision, to develop the chapter's tong-term activities.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The board normally hold board meetings once per month, where each member report on their doings, and issues that do not need to be decided at a chapter meeting are brought up.

        <h3>Chapter President</h3>
        <p>
          The chapter's goalkeeper and Commander-in-chief.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other electees deal with the chapter's day to day operations and events. As chapter president, however, your job is to make sure that everyone else can keep doing their thing without issue by solving any overarching problems that pop up along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are few people in their early twenties that get the opportunity to be responsible for an organisation with a yearly turnover around 2MSEK with hundreds of members.
          <br/>
          As chapter president you get the opportunity to take charge, with the support of others as you learn the ropes of leading a rather large organisation.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>You <strong>represent the students</strong> towards THS central as well as KTH's EECS school.</li>
          <li>You <strong>lead</strong> the chapter's board and work with every part of the organisation, as well as all the fantastic people that are engaged in the chapter.</li>
          <li>As president your main task is to <strong>solve problems</strong>. They can  be anything from keeping Kistan 2.0 accessible to students during exam periods to diplomatically presenting the chapter's opinion to KTH.</li>
          <li>Together with the treasurer you are the chapter's <strong>authorized signatory</strong> and will be handling a lot of different agreements and contracts. The two of you are also jointly responsible for the chapter's serving license.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Vice President</h3>
        <p>
          It's lonely at the top. Every leader needs a second in command they can rely on.
        </p>
        <p>
          The vice president's primary task is to support the president, be it by taking care of a delegated task, or by providing a second opinion on a problem at hand.
          <br>
          Just like the president you will be gaining experience in leading and managing a large organisation and the people belonging to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          You might not bear the brunt of the legal responsibilities that come with the power vested in the president, but this is nonetheless a role with a very large impact on the organisation.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>You <strong>support</strong> the president through handling delegated tasks and working with the board.</li>
          <li>Just like the president you will <strong>represent the students</strong> towards THS central as well as KTH's EECS school.</li>
          <li>You will learn how to <strong>participate in and conduct</strong> meetings of many kinds.</li>
          <li>You will primarily be working with <strong>strategic issues</strong>, but expect there to be plenty of <strong>operational problems</strong> to sink your teeth into.</li>

        <h3>Chapter Treasurer</h3>
        <p>
          Money makes the world go round.
        </p>
        <p>
          As chapter treasurer you are responsible for the economy of an organisation with a yearly turnover around 2MSEK.
          <br/>
          This might seem like some very big shoes to fill, but with the plethora of support given by THS it is a far smaller - but still rather time-consuming - task than you might fear. Especially since you are supported by a deputy treasurer.
        </p>
        <p>
          As chapter treasurer you will gain experience in managing the economy of a quite large non-profit organisation as well as in leading and supporting subordinates that are spread across the chapter's committees.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>You <strong>manage</strong> the chapter's financial means.</li>
          <li>You are the <strong>primary source of knowledge</strong> for creating the chapter's yearly budget.</li>
          <li>You <strong>support and coordinate</strong> the committee's treasurers with regard to anything from weekly orders to large investments.</li>
          <li>Together with the treasurer you are the chapter's <strong>authorized signatory</strong> and will be handling a lot of different agreements and contracts. The two of you are also jointly responsible for the chapter's serving license.</li>

        <p>
          You can always edit a bad page. You can’t edit a blank page.
        </p>
        <p>
          As chapter secretary you are responsible for maintaining and updating the chapter's statutes and other documents. While it might seem unglamorous the secretary is a <strong>very</strong> important role, within the board and the chapter, as you are the person that knows the statutes and procedures the best.
        </p>
        <p>
          As chapter secretary your tasks are primarily administrative, but with plenty of boardwork to go around there are always more hands-on things to do.
          <br/>
          Turn into Union Council person!
          <br/>
          Overhaul the chapter's statutes and memos, help members write motions then poke holes in them.

        <ul>
          <li>You are <strong>responsible for maintaining</strong> the chapter's documents.</li>

          <li>You <strong>work together with</strong> the board and the chapter's auditors to <strong>interpret</strong> the chapter's statutes.</li>
          <li>You <strong>prepare meeting agendas</strong> for board and chapter meetings and write protocols, propositions and answers to motions and interpellations with the help of the rest of the board..</li>
