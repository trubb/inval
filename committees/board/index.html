            <h3>Chapter President</h3>
            <p>
              The chapter's president is like the chapter's goalie.
              <br/>The other electees deal with the day to day operations and events. As chapter president your job is to make sure that everyone else can keep doing their thing without issue, and at the same time solving any problems that pop up along the way.
              <br/>
              There are few people in their early twenties that get the opportunity to be responsible for an organisation with a yearly turnover around 2MSEK with hundreds of members.
              <br/>
              As chapter president you get the opportunity to take charge, with the support of others as you learn the ropes.
            </p>

              <li>You <strong>lead</strong> the the chapter's board and work with every part of the organisation and all the fantastic people that are engaged in the chapter.</li>
              <li>As president your main task is to <strong>solve problems</strong>. They can  be anything from keeping Kistan 2.0 accessible to students during exam periods to diplomatically presenting the chapter's opinion to KTH.</li>
              <li>Together with the treasurer you are the chapter's <strong>authorized signatory</strong> and will be handling a lot of different agreements and contracts. You are also jointly responsible for the chapter's serving license.</li>
